# IFM-Image-Defect-Detection-and-Classification
This repository aims to develop a program for reading IFM (Interferometric Microscope) images and accurately detecting and classifying various defects present in the samples. The primary focus is on creating robust algorithms that can analyze high-resolution IFM images and identify defects such as scratches, cracks, voids, and other irregularities. The project is intended to streamline defect analysis in materials science and manufacturing, enabling more efficient and automated quality control processes.

Key features of this project include:

  Image Preprocessing: Techniques to enhance and normalize IFM images for better defect detection.
  Defect Detection: Algorithms to automatically detect defects within the images.
  Defect Classification: Machine learning models to classify detected defects into predefined categories.
  Visualization: Tools for visualizing detected defects and their classifications.
  
This repository is under active development, and contributions are welcome.
